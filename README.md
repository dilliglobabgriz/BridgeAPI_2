## üìÑ **Requirements**
All dependencies can be found in the `pom.xml` file.  
Currently using:
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.4.3

## üöÄ **Steps to Play**
1. **Initialize 4 players**
    - Create 4 bot players.
2. **Initialize a new game**
    - Connect player IDs to the game and save to DB.
3. **Initialize a new round**
    - Deal 13 cards per player.
4. **Start the bidding process**
    - Get bids from each player until a final contract is determined.
    - Save the winning contract and the player who bid it to the hand.
    - Serialize bid history and add to round instance
5. **Start the trick-taking process**
    - Get one card from each player, starting with the left of the dealer.
    - Determine who won the trick and update the score.
    - Serialize trick history and add to round instance
6. **Score the round**
    - Determine the score based on the contract, tricks taken, and vulnerability.
7. **Save round to the DB**
8. **Save hands to the DB**
    - Serialize hands and add connect them with playerId in DB
9. **Start new round**
    - Until game is over start a new round
