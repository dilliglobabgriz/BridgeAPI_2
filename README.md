## ‚öôÔ∏è **Project Overview**
Full stack web application using Java's Spring Boot framework. Allows users to play and enjoy the game of Bridge.

---

## üìÑ **Requirements**
All dependencies can be found in the `pom.xml` file.  
Currently using:
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.4.3

---

## üöÄ **Steps to Play**
1. **Initialize 4 players**
    - Create 4 bot players.
2. **Initialize a new game**
    - Connect player IDs to the game and save to DB.
3. **Initialize a new round**
    - Deal 13 cards per player.
4. **Start the bidding process**
    - Get bids from each player until a final contract is determined.
    - Save the winning contract and the player who bid it to the hand.
5. **Start the trick-taking process**
    - Get one card from each player, starting with the left of the dealer.
    - Determine who won the trick and update the score.
6. **Score the round**
    - Determine the score based on the contract, tricks taken, and vulnerability.
7. **Save game/round to the DB**

## üéØ **Possible Future Features**
- Support for one or more human players.
- Adding more extensive trick and bid history to the DB.
- Improved UI/UX.

---

## üìè **Dev Notes**
- Implement BidType to Suit conversion to handle NT bids and trump cases.
- Create `Hand` (for game) and `Hand` (for players) as separate classes.
